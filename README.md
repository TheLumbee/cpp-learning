# Basics

### Command Line
For practical reasons, the principles of this course will assume that the learner is \
familiar with a CLI (command line interface). \
All the work done in this course will be done using a command line. \
Regardless of the host OS, it is expected that the learners will be able to use a command line for this course.

### Git
In order to use this course, you must be familiar with git. \
There are a number of resources available to learn git. \
This link [here](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp?remote=github) provides simple, concise information to help you understand git basics.

# Content

### Software and Hardware
The content of this course focuses on learning C++ and general computer science information. \
Along with learning the language, the content may also focus on build systems, \
various testing frameworks, design principles, hardware components and functionalities, \
or any other information that is deemed important.

### Structure
The course will be structured with concise information for a specific topic. \
The content of each topic could contain learning resources, exercises, questions, or any other learning material. \
\
The topics themselves will be structured in various directories. \
The learner will be expected to study each topic and complete any material involved. \
\
The learner *should* clone the repo and create branches for learning each topic. \
The learner may wish to create directories in their individual branches that mirror the course material. \
Any exercises that need to be completed can be done in those directories. \
\
The content may be organized into various modules. \
As it's planned, each module will have a project that would need to be completed \
before advancing to the next module. \
Some modules, and therefore projects, will allows learners to collaborate and work together. \
In those cases, the directory names for each learner should be specified in the directory.

# Misc Rules
## Pull Requests
All PRs (pull requests) to the main branch must be approved by the code owner.

## Large Language Model (LLM) Assistance
It is expected that the learner will not use any AI tools for the material in this course. \
While using AI tools can be largely beneficial in many cases, \
using AI tools could hinder the learners ability to solve unique problems that advance learning.
