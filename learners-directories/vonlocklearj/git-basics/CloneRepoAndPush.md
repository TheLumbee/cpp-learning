# Purpose
The purpose of this course is to learn how to clone, modify, and push to an existing git repository. \
Since no work can be done in the repository without this knowledge, this comes first.

## Solo Work

### Exercise 1
Clone this repository locally.

*Note*: \
The repo should be cloned in a location where the learner can easily access and modify with admin \
priviledges in the host OS.

### Exercise 2
Create a local branch to make modifications. This branch can be named whatever the learner likes \
but it should be clear that the learner knows what the branch's purpose is.

### Exercise 3
The learner will create a directory in `/learners-directories` that should be named exactly \
as the username appears on Github.

### Exercise 4
Push the changes to a remote branch with the same name as the local branch.

*Note*: \
It's possible that the learner could face permissions issues at this point. \
With the many resources available on the internet, the user should learn how to resolve this issue.

### Exercise 5
Create a pull request to merge into the main branch.
Once this PR is approved, the learner may advance in the course.
