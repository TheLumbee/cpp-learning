# Purpose
The purpose of this lesson is to setup a simple cmake project and build it. \
CMake is a powerful and widely used build system for C/C++ projects. \
CMake will be used extensively in this course. \
It is the learner's responsibility to install and make cmake usable on their host system.

*Reminder* \
The learner should create a directory and file stucture in their personal directory \
as it's laid out here in the modules directory.

## Solo Work

### Exercise 1
At the root of the .cpp file, create a build folder for the cmake output.

### Exercise 2
Create a *CMakeLists.txt* file containing all the necessary information to build the *hello_world.cpp* file. \
See the documentation [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html) for cmake.

### Exercise 3
Generate all the cmake output in the correct build directory and build the executable.

### Exercise 4
Run the executable and screenshot the output. \
Commit and push an image of the output along with the *CMakeLists.txt* file to the learner's directory.

*Note* \
The build folder will be ignored by git.
